# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the contest) 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Edit this README

Under "SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE" heading below, include the following:

- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
  - [ ] When linking, please provide all links as full absolute links versus relative links
  - [ ] All information should be provided in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [ ] Under the "Scope" heading, provide the name of each contract and:
  - [ ] source lines of code (excluding blank lines and comments) in each
  - [ ] external contracts called in each
  - [ ] libraries used in each
- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [ ] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [ ] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

## C4udit / Publicly Known Issues

*Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in the C4udit output is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards.*

# Overview

We are releasing Layer 1 smart contracts for [zkSync version 2.0](https://v2.zksync.io/) - a general-purpose zero knowledge rollup solution for Ethereum. For more information and fundamental concepts please refer to the documentation [here](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/#fundamental-topics).

This repository contains Layer 1 (i.e. Ethereum mainnet) part of zkSync v2.0, a set of Solidity smart contracts that take care of governance, upgradability, L1 to L2 communication, etc. Detailed description of these smart contracts and their purpose can be found [here](https://matterlabs.notion.site/zkSync-2-0-smart-contracts-overview-fad227fac94241898417771e4a415f83).

Please pay special attention to any issues allowing:
- Unauthorized upgrade
- Successful verification of an invalid block
- Execution of an unverified block

While we are in Alpha version of the system it is assumed that Matter Labs, an operator/governor behind zkSync, is not malicious. Any findings that require governor privileges will therefore be considered irrelevant.

# Scope

**Waiting for the code to finalize**

| Contract | SLOC | Purpose | Libraries used |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| contracts/folder/sample.sol | 123 | This contract does XYZ | [`@openzeppelin/*`](<(https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/)>) |

## Out of scope

**Tests and hardhat plugins?**
*List any files/contracts that are out of scope for this audit.*

**Please confirm or edit the following scoping details**

# Tests

*Provide every step required to build the project from a fresh git clone, as well as steps to run the tests with a gas report.* 

*Note: Many wardens run Slither as a first pass for testing.  Please document any known errors with no workaround.*
